/*
DXT1/DXT3/DXT5 texture decompression

The original code is from Benjamin Dobell, see below for details. Compared to
the original the code is now valid C89, has support for 64-bit architectures
and has been refactored. It also has support for additional formats and uses
a different PackRGBA order.
